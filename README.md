RAY-X is a simulation and design tool for beamlines in energy storage rings. It traces synchrotron radiation through a series of mirrors, gratings and more and gives the user helpful insights, how a given beamline performs. 

This software is the predecessor of [RAY-UI](https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/forschung/oe/wi/optik-strahlrohre/arbeitsgebiete/ray_en.html) and aims to reengineer a valuable tool for physicists, engineers and others working on beamlines for electron storage rings.

For the moment we only support a cli application for the RayCore-library, which will enable you to trace beamlines created through RAY-UI efficiently. The main reason for the faster simulations is that we make use of dedicated GPUs.


Please have a look at the wiki if you are interested in the project, or contact us if you have any questions or bug concerning RAY-X.
