This will be the place, where we will create the new (reworked) version of Ray-UI.

Following goals are set for this project:
- Modularization of the old Ray-UI project for:
    - Better maintenance
    - Easier readability
- Translating the Fortran code to C++ code
- Improving performance of the tracing simulation with gpu acceleration
